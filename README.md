# Risk-based Portfolio Allocation Strategies: A short course

This material provides an overview of some classical risk-based portfolio allocation techniques as well as some recently proposed clustering-based ones. Examples using the R packages `RiskPortfolios` and `HierPortfolios` are provided and an empircal example assesing the out-of-sample performance is carried out.
This short course was taught in the XVIII ENCPOS, Campinas - SP (2024).
